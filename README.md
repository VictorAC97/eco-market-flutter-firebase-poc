# eco_market_flutter

A new Flutter project that I'm creating as a sample of concepts that I'm currently studying.
Eco Market is a fictional market that sells healthy food and the idea is to be a full online shop that has registration, user authentication, shopping chart, buying, etc.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
