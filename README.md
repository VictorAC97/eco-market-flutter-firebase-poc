A new Flutter project that I'm creating as a sample of concepts that I'm currently studying. Eco Market is a fictional market that sells healthy food and the idea is to be a full online shop that has registration, user authentication, shopping chart, buying, etc.

In this project, im studying how to use Firebase solutions in a fictional market app
