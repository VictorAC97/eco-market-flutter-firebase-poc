# Eco Market App


## About

Eco Market App is a new POC project that I'm creating as a sample of concepts that I'm currently studying. Eco Market is a fictional market that sells healthy food and the idea is to be a full online shop that has registration, user authentication, shopping chart, buying, etc.

In this project, im studying how to use Firebase solutions to support the possible user actions within the app.

## Technologies
- Flutter
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Cloud Firestore

## Demonstration
Here you can see some of the screens of the app:
